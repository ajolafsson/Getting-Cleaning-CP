Getting-Cleaning-CP
===================

This repo contains my submissions for the Coursera Getting Cleaning Data Course Project in September 2014.

I have included the raw data in this repo, however, I designed my script (run_analysis.R) to run by pulling the data directly from the URL, the raw source of the data. It was helpful to peruse the files in Windows in order to know what I should do with them in the script.

I have added comment lines within the code for run_analysis.R. Please read those comments for more information on what I'm doing in the script along with the code itself.

I have also added a CodeBook file that describes the variables.
